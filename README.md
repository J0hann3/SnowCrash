# üìú About

> This project will be an introduction to cyber security.

Welcome to the **Snowcrash** project, an exciting and educational exercise from **42 School** designed to deepen your understanding of system vulnerabilities. This project challenges you to identify and exploit security flaws in a virtual machine (VM), with each level presenting unique obstacles.

This project provides hands-on experience with:
- Understanding and analyzing security flaws.
- Writing exploits and reverse engineering.
- Practicing ethical hacking techniques.

## üöÄ Features

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with basic exploitation techniques and progress to advanced concepts.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Simulates vulnerabilities commonly found in real-world systems.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Gain practical skills in cybersecurity and penetration testing.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use

- Access Levels:
  - Begin the challenge by logging into the VM using the credentials for the first level.
  - Each level will provide a clue or a flag needed to access the next level.

- Analyze the Environment:
  - Investigate files, permissions, and binaries available at each level.
  - Use tools like `strings`, `gdb`, and `find` to analyze behavior.

- Exploit Vulnerabilities:
  - Find weaknesses in the system.
  - Exploit them responsibly to retrieve the flag for the next level.

  - Capture Flags:
    - Each level contains a flag stored in a specific file.
    - Successfully exploiting the level grants you access to this flag.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques
Below are some tools and techniques that help me during the project:

  - Basic Linux Commands: `ls`, `cat`, `find`, `chmod`, `chown`
  - Debugging Tools: `gdb`, `string`
  - Network Analysis: `nc`, `tshark`, `curl`
  - Reverse Engineering: `objdump`, `ghidra`, `xxd`
