find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null # command use to find all the files on the Vm that are owned by `flag00`

# We get two paths to a file named `john`
# In this file there is `cdiiddwpgswtgt`
# With `https://www.dcode.fr/identification-chiffrement` the cipher the most probably use is Affine Cipher
# With `https://www.dcode.fr/chiffre-affine` I decrypt the sentence and find `nottoohardhere` to be the flag with A=1,B=15
# Flag00 is `nottoohardhere`
